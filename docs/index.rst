Elizabeth
=========

**Elizabeth** is a fast and easy to use Python library for generating dummy data for a variety of purposes.  This data can be particularly useful during software development and testing.  For example, it could be used to populate a testing database for a web application with user information such as email addresses, usernames, first names, last names, etc.

There are over eighteen different `data providers <https://github.com/lk-geimfari/elizabeth/blob/master/PROVIDERS.md>`_ available, which can produce data related to food, people, computer hardware, transportation, addresses, and more.  *Elizabeth* does not require any modules that are not in the Python standard library.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    ➜ git clone https://github.com/lk-geimfari/elizabeth.git
    ➜ cd elizabeth/
    ➜ make install

or simply:

Basic Usage
-----------

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from elizabeth import Personal
    >>> p = Personal()
    >>>
    >>> p.full_name(gender='female')
    'Antonetta Garrison'
    >>> p.blood_type()
    'O-'
    >>> p.occupation()

Locales
-------

You can specify a locale when creating providers and they will return data that is appropriate for the language or country associated with that locale.  `Elizabeth` currently includes support for 23 different locales:

Usage
~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from elizabeth import Text
    >>> en = Text()  # English is Elizabeth's default locale
    >>> de = Text('de')
    >>> en.sentence()
    'Ports are used to communicate with the external world.'
    >>> de.sentence()
    'Wir müssen nicht vergessen Zickler.'
    >>>
    >>> en.color()
    'Blue'
    >>> de.color()
    'Türkis'

When you only need to generate data for a single locale, use the `Generic` provider, and you can access all `Elizabeth`
providers from one object.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from elizabeth import Generic
    >>> g = Generic('es')
    >>> g.datetime.month()
    'Agosto'
    >>> g.code.imei()
    '353918052107063'
    >>> g.food.fruit()
    'Limón'
